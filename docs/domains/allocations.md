# Domain: Allocations

**Status: proposed as a full domain — partially realized.** Staffing People onto
Projects over time — the heart of capacity planning. The first concrete cut of the
Allocation entity **already exists** as `project_roles` in the Projects domain (see
[projects.md](./projects.md)), and a **read-only company-wide planner view**
(`/allocations`) now surfaces that data as a **day/week/month grid** (see *The planner
view* below). The rest of the domain (a dedicated capacity model, forecast vs. actuals,
conflict handling) is still proposed.

## The planner view (realized) — a read over `project_roles`, not a new table

`/allocations` is a **read-only, company-wide** grid: **rows = active staff**,
**columns = time buckets** over a user-chosen date range. A **"View by" segmented
toggle** (`ToggleGroup`) picks the column granularity — **Day / Week (default) /
Month** (`Granularity`). It's a **view over existing tables — no schema change**. It
reads `project_roles` (the plan), `staff` + `staff_employment` (who + their current
facts), and `staff_pto` (availability). It is **visible to everyone signed in — no
permission gate** (the same open-read posture as the staff/CRM/projects lists).

- **Default window + range stepping.** Before the user touches the range, the window is
  the current bucket + the next N−1: **14 days / 12 weeks / 6 months**
  (`DEFAULT_WINDOW`, `defaultWindow(granularity)`), anchored at today. **Switching
  granularity re-seeds the range** to that granularity's default window (a leftover week
  range makes no sense as days). Two calendar endpoint pickers set an explicit range;
  the **prev/next chevrons shift the whole window by one bucket** of the active
  granularity (`planner-range.tsx`, `shiftBy`).
- **What a cell shows — the *nominal rate* at every granularity.** A role's cell shows
  its steady-state load = **`hoursPerDay / 8h`** (e.g. 4h/day → 50%, 8h/day → 100%,
  capped at 100), with a tooltip (project, role, duration, status, "% of
  {day|week|month}"). **The granularity only changes column width and how the start/end
  edges land**, not the headline percentage — *except* that a week still prorates its
  partial start/end columns (the historical behavior). Specifically (`bucketPercent`):
  - **Day** — one column per **calendar day**; **all 7 days render, weekends dimmed and
    empty** (`bg-muted/30`, `isWeekend`) since the allocation model only counts
    weekdays. An in-range weekday shows the nominal rate; weekends / out-of-range days
    are empty.
  - **Week** — **prorates** partial start/end weeks: `hoursPerDay × (active Mon–Fri
    weekdays that week) / 40` (`weekPercent`), so a mid-week edge or a part-day shows a
    partial %. Unchanged from before.
  - **Month** — one column per **calendar month**; shows the **flat nominal rate** for
    any month the role is active in — **NOT** prorated by how many working days of the
    month it covers. The month containing `startDate`/`endDate` carries the start/end
    edge marker. (Week-vs-month proration inconsistency is deliberate — see
    [ADR 0040](../decisions/0040-allocations-planner-granularity.md).)
- **Time off is prorated over the bucket's working days at every granularity** — away
  weekdays / total weekdays in the column (`awayWeekdays / totalWeekdays`): a day is
  100% when covered, a week divides by 5 (unchanged), a month by its working-day count.
  It renders as a neutral **"Away"** strip (availability only), whose tooltip shows the
  away period's start/end dates and "% of {day|week|month}" (reason gated — see below).
- **Column headers are granularity-aware** (`columnLabel`): a day is `Mon, Jul 6`, a
  week is a compact Mon–Fri range `Jul 6–10` / `Jun 29–Jul 3` (`weekColumnLabel`), a
  month is `Jul 2026`. **Confirmed** roles render as a solid block, **tentative** as a
  dashed outline; a solid bar on a cell's leading/trailing edge marks the column a role
  starts/ends in.
- **Staff column.** Each person's name is a **link to their `/staff/[id]` profile
  (opens in a new tab)**, and **hourly** staff (`employmentType === "HOURLY"`) carry an
  **"Hourly" badge**. `employmentType` is threaded onto the `AllocationRow` for this.
- **What appears.** Only **staffed** roles (non-null `staffId` — placeholders/open
  positions have no person to row) with status **`tentative` or `confirmed`**;
  `paused`/`cancelled` roles are excluded (not an active allocation). Only **approved**
  (non-pending) PTO is shown.
- **PTO disclosure is minimal, and gated.** Everyone sees the reason-free "Away"
  strip **plus the away period's start/end dates** (the min-start/max-end across the
  leave spans overlapping that week — availability info); only the leave **type** is
  gated, revealed to viewers holding **`pto.review`** (`getAllocationsGrid` nulls the
  `type` field otherwise). Showing the dates is still just availability, not reason —
  the gate is unchanged. See [ADR 0038](../decisions/0038-allocations-planner-pto-disclosure.md)
  and [permissions.md](./permissions.md).
- **Filter bar.** Narrows the staff rows in-memory (the once-fetched-list pattern the
  staff directory uses) by name, line of business, employment type, role, and skills.
  The skills multi-select is the shared `src/components/form/skills-filter.tsx`
  (extracted from the staff directory, now used by both). The **Role** filter is a
  **multiselect** (`MultiSelectFilter` chips, `src/components/form/filters.tsx`), not the
  single-select the other lists use, and **defaults to the billable disciplines** —
  `roleOptions.filter(isBillableRole)` (the `isBillableRole` predicate + `NON_BILLABLE_ROLES`
  from `src/lib/staff/staff-enums.ts` are the single source of the billable/overhead split,
  also used by the staff-import `isBillable` derivation), intersected with the roles actually
  present in the data — so the planner opens on the people who bill client work rather than
  the whole company. Its semantics differ from
  `SelectFilter`: **there is no `ALL` sentinel — the selection *is* the accepted set**, so
  clearing it matches no one and the "No staff match these filters" empty state shows.

### Code map

- **Read:** `src/actions/allocations/getAllocationsGrid.ts` (server-only; also
  re-exports `allocationsFilterOptions = STAFF_FILTER_OPTIONS`). Two-query
  latest-employment-per-person fold (no N+1), mirroring `getStaffDirectory`.
- **Pure grid math:** `src/lib/allocations/allocations-grid.ts` — builds the
  column spine at the chosen granularity (`buildColumns` → `eachDay`/`eachWeek`/
  `eachMonth`), folds staff + roles + PTO into one row per person, and computes each
  column's percentage via **`bucketPercent(role, granularity, colStart)`**: `weekPercent`
  for weeks (the prorated `hoursPerDay × active weekdays / 40`), the flat `nominalRatePercent`
  (`hoursPerDay / 8h`, capped at 100) for an in-range day or month. Exports the
  `Granularity` type + `GRANULARITIES` / `GRANULARITY_LABELS` / `DEFAULT_WINDOW` /
  `defaultWindow` / `buildColumns` / `columnLabel` / `bucketPercent`, and still
  **`weekPercent`** + `WORKING_DAYS_PER_WEEK`. Client-importable (no `db`/drizzle),
  reusing the timesheet date helpers. **Types were renamed for the multi-granularity
  move:** `WeekCell` → **`BucketCell`**, and `AllocationRow.weeks` → **`AllocationRow.cells`**;
  `buildAllocationRows` gained `columns` (was `weekColumns`) and `granularity` params.
  **`src/lib/projects/project-planner-grid.ts`** (the opportunity planner's grid, still
  weekly-only) still **imports `weekPercent` from here** rather than duplicating the
  math, so the two planners agree on a week's load — keep this the single source and
  update both call sites when the load formula changes.
- **Date helpers:** `src/lib/timesheets/timesheet-week.ts` grew the day/month math the
  grid needs — `addDays`, `getMonthStart`, `addMonths`, `eachDay`, `eachMonth`,
  `currentDay`, `currentMonthStart` (alongside the existing week helpers). Still **no
  date library** — string-based local-parts arithmetic throughout.
- **UI:** `src/components/allocations/allocations-planner.tsx` (filter bar + granularity
  state + "View by" toggle + window), `planner-range.tsx` (granularity-aware prev/next
  stepping + aria-labels), `allocations-grid.tsx` (render-only grid + legend, taking
  `columns`/`granularity` props, dimming weekend day-columns, granularity-aware labels
  and tooltip copy), page `src/app/(app)/allocations/page.tsx`. Nav entry added to
  `NAV_ITEMS` (`src/components/app-shell/nav.ts`), ungated.

## Purpose

Decide who works on what, when, and how much — and keep the plan reconcilable against availability and actuals.

## Key entities

- **Allocation** — a *time-ranged* assignment of a Person to a Project: start/end dates, capacity (% or hours/week), and project role.
  - **First cut realized as `project_roles`** (`src/lib/db/projects-schema.ts`): a
    staffing line = a `staff` member (or a **placeholder / open position** when `staffId`
    is null) of a given `roleType` (discipline) for a `startDate`/`endDate` range at
    `hoursPerDay` (default 8). Line of business lives on the **parent project**, not the
    role ([ADR 0025](../decisions/0025-line-of-business-on-opportunity-and-project-not-role.md)).
    It's a **data-carrying row**,
    not a pure junction. Placeholders let a Project define needed roles before anyone is
    chosen (e.g. during an opportunity's Allocating stage). Today these are **simple
    mutable rows, NOT effective-dated history** like `staff_employment` — so they can't
    reconstruct a past plan, and there's no flow yet to staff a placeholder after the fact.
    When this domain grows beyond create+read, `project_roles` may need to evolve toward
    history-as-rows. See [projects.md](./projects.md),
    [ADR 0017](../decisions/0017-project-roles-as-first-allocation-cut.md), and
    [ADR 0024](../decisions/0024-opportunity-project-handoff-and-placeholder-roles.md).
  - **Soft vs. hard is now modelled.** A role carries a **`status`** (`tentative` →
    `confirmed`) plus an **`opportunityId`** provenance FK. A role planned against an
    opportunity is `tentative` (soft — editable in that opportunity's planner) and
    **auto-confirms** (hard — locked) when the opportunity is won. This is the first concrete
    answer to the soft/hard question below, still as a **status flag on simple rows**, not
    effective-dated history. See [projects.md](./projects.md) and
    [ADR 0031](../decisions/0031-opportunity-project-planner-and-role-status.md).

## Key flows

- **Staffing** — given a Project's needs, find People with the right StaffProfile skills and spare capacity, then allocate them for a date range.
- **Capacity planning** — sum each Person's allocations across Projects vs. their availability to spot over/under-allocation.
- **Forecast vs. actuals** — Allocations are the *plan*; TimeEntries are the *actuals*. Comparison drives re-forecasting.

## Connects to

- **Staff profiles** — skills + availability drive who can be allocated.
- **Timesheets** — actuals (`time_entries`) are logged against the same Person↔Project pairing (now **built**; logging isn't restricted to allocated projects). Reconciling actuals against the `project_roles` plan is still unbuilt. See [domains/timesheets.md](./timesheets.md).
- **Performance** — utilization (from allocations vs. availability) is a performance input.

## Open questions

- Capacity unit: percentage, hours/week, or both?
- ~~Soft (tentative) vs. hard (confirmed) allocations?~~ **Resolved** — a role's `status`
  (`tentative` → `confirmed`, auto-confirmed on the opportunity's win) models exactly this.
  See [ADR 0031](../decisions/0031-opportunity-project-planner-and-role-status.md).
- How are conflicts/over-allocation surfaced and resolved? (The `/allocations` planner view
  lists each project a person is on per column with its own %, and the **opportunity planner** now
  greys a staffed person's **other-project commitments** into the grid — a first visibility cut —
  but nothing yet **sums** those into a total weekly load or flags >100% over-allocation.)
- How are the planner-view percentages (the *plan*) reconciled against timesheet
  actuals? Still unbuilt.
