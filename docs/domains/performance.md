# Domain: Performance management

**Status: partially built.** Two concrete slices are realized: **peer feedback**
and a **compensation & headcount analytics dashboard** (`/performance`, see
below). The broader review/goal machinery (ReviewCycle, PerformanceReview, Goal)
is still **proposed**.

## Purpose

Ground assessment and growth in real signals — peer input, project work,
utilization — rather than memory. The first shipped pieces let teammates capture
structured feedback about each other continuously (not just at review time), and
give finance/managers an aggregate read on workforce compensation & headcount.

## Peer feedback — **built**

Any **active** staff member can leave structured feedback about any **other**
active staff member. It's a **point-in-time** record: immutable once left, not
effective-dated, and a person can leave feedback about the same person more than
once (no unique `(from, to)` constraint).

### Entity — `feedback` (`src/lib/db/performance-schema.ts`)

The performance domain's first table (barrelled by `src/lib/db/schema.ts`,
migration `drizzle/0022_elite_khan.sql`):

- **`fromStaffId` / `toStaffId`** — giver and recipient, both FK → `staff.id`,
  both **`onDelete: cascade`** (feedback is meaningless without both people).
  Indexed on each side (`feedback_from_staff_idx`, `feedback_to_staff_idx`).
- **`rating`** — 5-point `feedback_rating` pgEnum. Values + labels + descriptions
  live in the pure, client-importable module **`src/lib/feedback-rating.ts`**
  (`FEEDBACK_RATINGS`), the single source the pgEnum, the zod schema, and the
  form's radio group all import — same shared-enum pattern as
  `line-of-business.ts` ([ADR 0016](../decisions/0016-junction-table-and-shared-enum-conventions.md)).
  Scale (best→worst): `ABOVE_AND_BEYOND`, `TOP_PERFORMER`, `SOLID_CONTRIBUTOR`,
  `MINOR_MISSES`, `NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT`.
- **`context`** — required free text: how/when the giver worked with the person.
- **`keepDoing` / `stopDoing` / `startDoing`** — optional prompts, but the schema
  **requires at least one** (`createFeedback.schema.ts` refine).
- **`other`** — optional free text.
- **`messageToRecipient`** — optional, and the **only** content field a recipient
  ever sees (alongside the giver's name).

### Privacy — three tiers, enforced by the read projections

The privacy boundary is **the reads, not the table** — the hidden columns simply
never leave the server for unauthorized callers. Three tiers:

1. **Anyone (active staff) — give feedback.** Gated by the
   `authorizeFeedbackCreate` hook (`authorizeFeedback.ts`), **not** a capability:
   the caller must be active staff, the target a distinct active staff member.
   The giver always sees the full feedback they wrote (`getFeedbackIGave` +
   `getFeedbackDetail` giver branch).
2. **Recipient — limited view.** `getFeedbackAboutMe` projects **only** the giver's
   name, `messageToRecipient`, and date — never the rating, context, or
   keep/stop/start/other. `getFeedbackDetail` also refuses full content to a mere
   recipient.
3. **Reviewer (`feedback.review`) — full view.** Managers/admins can view **any
   individual** feedback item in full via `getFeedbackDetail` (full content for
   any id — the detail page `/feedback/[id]`). A dedicated **browse-all list** of
   everyone's feedback is **deferred / planned** — it existed briefly
   (`getAllFeedbackPage` + an `all-feedback-table`) but was removed for now; the
   `feedback.review` capability itself is unchanged and still the reviewer gate.

> **"Manager" here means the `feedback.review` role capability, not a reporting
> line.** There is **no per-person manager/report graph** anywhere in this
> codebase — visibility is purely role-based (manager/admin see everything).

### Deliberate gap — reviewers see their own feedback

`feedback.review` currently grants a reviewer full visibility of **any** feedback,
**including feedback about themselves** (`getFeedbackDetail` does not exclude the
reviewer as recipient). This is a **known,
accepted limitation for the first slice**, not an oversight — locking down
managers reading their own feedback (e.g. routing it through the limited recipient
view) is flagged **future work**. See [ADR 0023](../decisions/0023-feedback-privacy-tiers.md).

### Actions & UI

- Actions in `src/actions/feedback/`: `createFeedback` (+ `.schema`),
  `authorizeFeedback` (`canGiveFeedback` + `authorizeFeedbackCreate`),
  `getFeedbackAboutMe`, `getFeedbackIGave`, `getFeedbackDetail`,
  `searchStaffForFeedback` (auth-only recipient picker, active staff excluding
  self — no capability, since giving is open).
- UI: nav item `/feedback` (`IconMessageHeart`), pages
  `src/app/(app)/feedback/page.tsx` (a **two-tab** view — "About you" /
  "You've given"), `feedback/new/page.tsx` (the **dedicated give-feedback page**),
  and `[id]/page.tsx` (detail). Components under `src/components/feedback/`:
  `feedback-form` (the give-feedback form, rendered on the `/new` page — replaced
  the old dialog), `feedback-about-me`, `feedback-given-table`, and
  `feedback-detail-fields` (renders a single feedback item's full content, backing
  the `[id]` detail page). New vendored
  primitive `src/components/ui/radio-group.tsx` (Base UI `Radio`/`RadioGroup`)
  for the rating picker. The recipient tab warns that only the message-to-recipient
  is visible; the detail page gates full content via `getFeedbackDetail`.

## Compensation analytics dashboard — **built**

The first **analytics** slice: an authenticated page at **`/performance`** showing
workforce **compensation & headcount**, overall and **broken down by role**.
Metrics per group: headcount, average compensation, comp range (min/max), average
hourly rate, and hourly-rate range. Reads **no new table** — it aggregates the
latest `staff_employment` row per **active** staff member (the same
latest-row-per-staff pattern `getStaffDirectory` uses). **No charting library** —
KPI cards, a plain table, and a **hand-rolled inline-SVG scatter** (see below).

- **"Compensation" = `base + guaranteedBonus`** (excludes `discretionaryBonus`,
  which isn't imported yet). Hourly stats use the stored `hourlyRate` column.
- **Filters** (segmented controls, default "All"): line of business, employment
  type (`FULL_TIME` / `HOURLY`), and role. Applied client-side over the once-
  fetched rows.
- **Currency toggle (CAD / USD).** Comp is stored per person in their own
  currency; all amounts are normalized to the selected display currency via live
  FX rates. See [ADR 0029](../decisions/0029-external-fx-rates-and-currency-normalization.md)
  for the FX pattern (first live external API call — frankfurter.dev, USD
  cross-rate, never-throw fallback). When rates are stale the page shows a "rates
  unavailable" note.

### Access control — reuses `staff.viewCompensation` (no matrix change)

An aggregate comp view is **bulk comp exposure**, so it's gated by the **existing**
`staff.viewCompensation` capability (finance / manager / admin — the same gate on
individual comp; see [permissions.md](./permissions.md)). **The permission matrix
is unchanged.** Defense in depth: the page `notFound()`s unauthorized users
(matching the hidden nav item), and the read `getCompensationSummaryData` calls
`requirePermission(user, { staff: ["viewCompensation"] })` again server-side.

The nav item is **hidden** from users who lack the capability via the new
permission-aware sidebar mechanism (`NavItem.permission` → `visibleNavHrefs`; see
[ui.md](../ui.md) → *App shell & sidebar* and [architecture.md](../architecture.md)).

### Data read — anonymized rows

`getCompensationSummaryData` (`src/actions/staff/`) returns **anonymized** rows —
dimensions (lineOfBusiness/role/employmentType/currency) + amounts, **no
id/name/email**. Identity never leaves the server even for authorized viewers: the
client only filters, currency-normalizes, and aggregates. It also exports
`performanceFilterOptions` (the enum arrays) so the page/UI never import Drizzle.

### Pure helpers & UI

- **`src/lib/fx.ts`** (`AED_PER_USD`, `FALLBACK_USD_RATES`, `convert`) and
  **`src/lib/performance-stats.ts`** (`computeGroupStats`, `computeByRole` — pure
  aggregation over normalized rows; empty groups yield `null` so the UI renders an
  em dash, not NaN). Both client-importable and unit-tested (`fx.test.ts`,
  `performance-stats.test.ts`).
- UI: `src/app/(app)/performance/page.tsx` (server), `performance-dashboard.tsx`
  (client — filters, currency toggle, KPI cards, by-role table, distribution
  scatter), the reusable `stat-card.tsx` (a KPI tile extracted from the Home page's
  inline pattern), and `compensation-scatter.tsx` (the scatter, below).

### Distribution scatter

A **single-series scatter** at the bottom of the dashboard — one dot per staff
member, sorted **ascending** by the plotted value, so the eye reads the spread's
shape. X is just the employee rank (1..n, ticks hidden); y is the numeric value;
per-dot detail is a native `<title>`. A **metric toggle** (segmented control)
switches between **Compensation** (`base + guaranteedBonus`) and **Hourly rate**
(`hourlyRate`), both normalized to the selected display currency like the rest of
the dashboard. It **reuses the dashboard's already-filtered, currency-normalized
per-staff rows** — the memo now returns the individual `StatRow[]` (`rows`)
alongside the aggregates, so no extra read or recompute. `CompensationScatter`
(`src/components/performance/compensation-scatter.tsx`) is metric-agnostic: it
takes plain `values: number[]` + a `formatValue` + a `caption`. **The chart is
hand-rolled inline SVG — no charting library.** This is the documented pattern for
charts in this codebase; see [ui.md](../ui.md) → *Charts (hand-rolled SVG)* for the
dataviz styling rules.

## Still proposed

- **ReviewCycle** — a period in which reviews happen (quarterly, annual).
- **PerformanceReview** — a Person's assessment within a cycle; may pull in project
  work and utilization.
- **Goal** — an objective for a Person, tracked over time.

Proposed flows: review cycle (open → collect self/manager/peer input → assess →
close), goal setting & tracking, and an evidence pull surfacing allocations,
utilization, and project contributions as review context.

## Connects to

- **Staff profiles** — feedback is staff↔staff; both endpoints are `staff` rows.
  Only **active** staff participate. The analytics dashboard reads the latest
  `staff_employment` compensation for every **active** staff member. Future reviews
  would target a Person and may update role/seniority.
- **Timesheets / Allocations** — utilization and delivery are intended review
  inputs (not yet wired).
- **Permissions** — `feedback.review` (manager + admin) is the reviewer tier;
  the analytics dashboard reuses `staff.viewCompensation` (finance/manager/admin).
  See [domains/permissions.md](./permissions.md).

## Open questions (for the proposed pieces)

- Review types: self / manager / 360, and how peer feedback feeds them.
- How tightly utilization factors into ratings (and who can see it).
- Cycle cadence; whether the peer-feedback rating scale is reused for reviews.
- Locking down reviewers seeing their own feedback (the deferred gap above).
